	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, making them faster and more scalable.</p>
    <p>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. An algorithm with low space complexity is more efficient in terms of memory usage. Typically, space complexity is expressed as <b>Space Complexity</b> O(n).</p>
